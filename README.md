# Vortiix
Revival service for Vortex

## Why

At the time Vortiix was created it was unknown if Vortex would continue to operate, specially after Discord decision to require all bots that have surpassed 100 servers to be verified to stay working correctly. It also had instability from occasional Discord bans (which still happen today sometimes) and the boit going offline unexpectedly.

Those reasons led to the creation of this, a fork of Vortex with changes specifically for the RC24 server and others.

## Inviting

The Vortiix instance that is used in the RiiConnect24 Discord server and other servers is private.
You can use this source code to host your own instance but please keep in mind no support will be offered.

If you want to use Vortex please use the [official public instance](https://github.com/jagrosh/Vortex/wiki/Getting-Started).

## Support

Please do not ask for support to the original author(s) or RiiConnect24.
